<p/>

The IUTools Spell Checker allows you to check the spelling of words in a pieces
of Inuktitut text. Below are some details about features and limitations of this
app.

<h2>Why are some of the suggestions identical to the mis-spelled word?</h2>

When checking syllabic text, it may somtimes <em>look</em> like the spell checker
is suggesting a correction that is identical to the mis-spelled word. But in fact,
the correction is not made up of the same characters. For example, althoug the
while following words may <em>look</em> the same:

<ul>
<li>ᓂᐊᖁᓐᖒ (ends with ᓐ+ᖒ = n+nguu)</li>
<li>ᓂᐊᖁᙴ  (ends with ᙴ = nngueu)</li>
</ul>

They end with different characters that happen to look he same.

<h2>Spell Check Level</h2>

The IUTools spell checker offers three levels of checking. As the level
increases, it catche more types of mistakes, but it also gets slower.

<h3>Level 1</h3>

At Level 1, the spell checker only performs a <em>shallow</em> check that searches for sequences of
characters which can never appear in a valid Inuktitut word. For example, it
checks that the word does not contain more than 2 consecutive consonnants.

<h3>Level 2</h3>

At Level 2, the spell checker performs all of the Level 1 checks, but it also
ensures that the word does not violate any morpheme composition rules. More
precisely, it checks that:

<ul>
    <li>The word is composed of a sequence of valid morphemes that are allowed to
        follow each other</li>
    <li>Each morpheme is written in a way that takes into account the morphemes
        that precede and follow it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Level 3</h3>

At Level 3, the spell checker performs all the Level 2 checks, plus it identifies
the correct portions of the word. More precisely, it identifies the longest
correct portions at the start and end of the word.

Identification of these correct portions uses a Level 2 analysis that takes
into account the morpheme composition rules.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

The spell checker has three main limitations

<ul>
    <li><b>Speed:</b> The spell checker can be slow when used with a level
        greater than the default of Level 1.</li>
    <li><b>Proper and foreign names:</b> The spell checker may inaccurately
        label proper and foreign names as being mis-spelled, eventhough they
        are written using their accepted Inuktitut spelling.</li>
    <li><b>Missing correct suggestions:</b> The list of suggestions may be missing
        the correct form, if that form was never seen by the spell checker before.</li>
</ul>
