<h1>About the dictionary</h1>

The InuktiTools Inutktitut-English dictionary provides information about Inutktitut words and
their corresponding English translation.
<p/>
Note that this dictionary was <b>automatically generated by a computer program</b>
and that its results have not been checked nor corrected by a human. As such,
it may  contain many mistakes, but our experience is that the partially correct
information it provides is still useful in most situations.
<p/>
The dictionary provides the following information (click on the link to learn
more about limitations of each section and how best to use it):
<ul>
    <li><a href="#translit">Word in different scripts</a>: The title bar of the dictionary
    entry provides the word in both <em>Syllabic</em> and <em>Roman</em> scripts.</li>
    <li><a href="#translations">Translations</a>: A list of possible translations for the word or
    expression.</li>
    <li><a href="#related_words">Related Words</a>: A list of frequent words that are closely related to
    the input word.</li>
    <li><a href="#morphological_decomp">Morphological Decomposition</a>: Shows how the word is made up from
    smaller morphemes, and provides the English definition of each of those
    morphemes.</li>
    <li><a href="#bilingual_examples">Examples of use</a>: List of bilingual (Inuktitut-English) sentences
    that illustrate how the words and its various translations can be used in context.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="translit">Word in different scripts</a></h2>

The title bar of the word entry window provides the input word in <em>Syllabic</em>
and <em>Roman</em> scripts. This is the one part of a word's entry that is <b>garanteed
    to be correct</b>, eventhough one of the two scripts version was generated by a machine.

<h2><a name="translations">Translations</a></h2>

The translations provided in this section were either:

<p/>

<ul>
    <li>Found in a human-generated glossary (in which case they will appear in
        <b>bold</b>)</li>
    <li>Generated automatically by a machine
        through the analysis of a large corpus of <b>human-translated</b> English-Inuktitut texts.
    </li>
</ul>

<p/>

The IUTools dictionary uses a number of publicly available human-generated glossaries
including:
<ul>
    <li>Wikipedia</li>
</ul>

On the other hand, machine-generated translations are produced by looking for
associations between words and phrases in sentences that are human-produced
translations of each other. For example, the machine may have noticed that Inuktitut
sentences which contain the word <em>"tunngasugit"</em> tend to be associated with
English sentences that contain the word <em>"welcome"</em>, and concluded (correctly
in this case) that those are translations of each other</div>

<p/>

Although they are computed based on human-translated texts, these associations
themselves were produced by the machine and were <b>never verified by a human</b>.
As a result the machine may produce many bad associations, in particular it may:

<ul>
    <li>Associate words and phrases that <b>tend to occur in similar contexts, without
        being translations</b> of each other.</li>
    <li>Include <b>unnecessary words</b> in a translation. These are typically words that
        tend to immediatly follow or preceed the translation. For example, it may have wrongly concluded that the English
        phrase <em>"welcome back"</em> is the translation for <em>"tunngasugit"</em>, when
        in fact the correct translation is just <em>"welcome"</em></li>
    <li>Miss some translations altogether.</li>
</ul>

<p/>

In some cases, the machine will not have seen the word or expression you are
looking for in the corpus it analyzed and as a result, it will not be able to show translations of that exact
word or expression. However, it <em>may</em> be able to show translations of words
that are <a href="#related_words">closely related</a> to the input word. In such cases, the heading for the
<em>Translations</em> section will mention: <em>"Related Words Only"</em>.

</p>

Because of these limitations, it is important to not get too hung up on any
individual translation proposed by the dictionary. Instead, you should look at
the set of translations as a whole and consult the
<a href="#bilingual_examples">examples of use</a> for each suggestion in order
to get a sense of what the word or expression might mean or translate to.

<h2><a name="related_words">Related Words</a></h2>

This section provides a list of frequent words that are morphologically close
to the input word. For example, if the input word was <em>"inngiqtut" ("singing")</em>,
the list of related words might include <em>"inngiqtiujuq" ("singer")</em>.

<p/>

Sometimes when the dictionary entry for a word does not allow you to understand
the word, you can find additional information by clicking on one or more of the
related words. In fact, the dictionary itself will sometimes augment a word's
entry with information gathered from the entries of related words. For example,
if the system cannot find a translation for the input word, it may list translations
that it found for some of the related words (in which case, the
<a href="#translations">Translations</a> section of the entry will mention: <em>"Related Words"</em>).

<h2><a name="morphological_decomp">Morphological Decomposition</a></h2>

The <em>Morphological Decomposition</em> section shows how the word can be
broken down into smaller meaningful units called morphemes. The docompositino also
provides the English meaning of each morpheme as well as it's <em>syntactic role</em>
(ex: <em>verb-root</em>, <em>verb-to-noun suffix</em>). This decompisition is often helpful for
understanding the meaning of the word and how to use it.

<p/>

Like for the <em>translations</em> the decomposition was also generated automatically
by a machine. However the algorithm used for that is rule-based and tends to be
more reliable than the algorithm used to produce translations. That said, it
can still err by:
<ul>
    <li>Failing to produce a decomposition for a word which is a morphologically
        correct word.</li>
    <li>Producing a decomposition that is "technically right" for that words
        (meaning that the word could be construed as consisting of that sequence
        of morpheme) while not being correct for that specific word.</li>
    <li>Producing a decomposition for a word that is in fact mis-spelled. This will happen
        if the misspelled word follows the morphological rules of Inuktitut, eventhough
        it is not an actual Inuktut word.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a name="bilingual_examples">Examples of use</a></h2>

For each of the possible translations mentioned in the
<a href="#translations">Translations</a> section, the entry will provide one or
more examples of use.

Each example consists of either:

<ul>
    <li>A reference to the human-generate glossary where the translation was found
        (ex: Wikipedia)</li>
    <li>a pair of English-Inuktitut sentences
        which are human-generated translations of each other, with the input word highlighted
        in one sentence, and its translation highghlighted in the other.
        <p/>
        As explained <a href="#translations">above</a>, the translation can be sometimes
        off, in which case the highlighted translation will not actually correspond to the
        input word. However, there is a very good chance that the sentence will still contain the correct
        translation, even if it was not highlighted. Usually the correct translation will
        sit close to the highlighted word in the sentence.
    </li>
</ul>
