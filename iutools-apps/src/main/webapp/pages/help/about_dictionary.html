<h1>About the dictionary</h1>

The InuktiTools Inutktitut-English dictionary was automatically generated by a
computer program, and its results have not been checked nor corrected by a human.
<p/>
As such, it may contain many mistakes, but our experience is that
the partially correct information and examples it provides are still useful in
most situations.
<p/>
The sections below provide more details about how the various sections of the
dictionary were generated and to use them:
<ul>
    <li><a href="#translations">Translations</a></li>
    <li><a href="#related_words">Related Words</a></li>
    <li><a href="#morphological_decomp">Morphological Decomposition</a></li>
    <li><a href="#bilingual_examples">Examples of use</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="translations">Translations</a></h2>

The translations provided in this section were generated automatically by a machine
that analyzed a large corpus of text that were translated by humans (typically
going from English to
Inuktitut).
<p/>
Basically, this machine finds possible translations by looking for
associations between words and phrases in sentences that are human-produced
translations of each other. For example, the machine may notice that Inuktitut
sentences which contain the word <em>"ulakut"</em> tend to be associated with
English sentences that contain the phrase <em>"good morning"</em>, and conclude that
those are translations of each other</div>

<p/>

Although they are computed based on human-translated texts, these associations
themselves are produced by the machine and never verified by a human. As a result
the machine may produce many bad associations, in particular the machine may:

<ul>
    <li>Associate words and phrases that tend to occur in similar contexts, without
    being translations of each other</li>
    <div style="text-indent:10px">For example: etc....</div>
    <li>Produce a translation that includes the correct translation, plus other words
    that tend to immediatly follow or preced that word or phrase.</li>
    <div style="text-indent:10px">For example: etc....</div>
    <li>Miss translations altogether</li>
    <div style="text-indent:10px">For example: etc....</div>
</ul>

<p/>

In some cases, the machine will not have seen the word or expression you are
looking for and as a result, it will not be able to show translations of that exact
word or expression. However, it <em>may</em> be able to show translations of words
that are closely related to the input word. In such cases, the heading for the
<em>Translations</em> section will have the mention <em>"Related Words"</em>.

</p>

Because of these limitations, it is important to not get too hung up on any
individual translation proposed by the dictionary. Instead, you should look at
the set of translations as a whole and consult the
<a href="#bilingual_examples">examples of use</a> for each suggestion in order
to get a sense of what the word or expression might mean or translate to.

A machine-generated dictionary finds possible translations of words using pairs of sentences that have been translated from English to Inuktitut or from Inuktitut to English. A computer program predicts that words might be translations of one another if they show up together frequently in sentences that are translations of one another. Most importantly, these translations have not been checked by people, so sometimes there will be mistakes. You may want to use other parts of the dictionary entry to get a better understanding of a term, or check with a fluent speaker.

When you look up an Inuktitut word in the dictionary, you will see up to four parts of the dictionary entry: English translations, Related words, Morphological decomposition, and Examples of use. English translations were machine-generated from the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut (see below for an explanation of how this is done). Related words are words that are similar to the word you looked up, for example ones that share the same root. The Morphological decomposition shows how the word can be broken down into smaller meaningful units. This is done by a different computer program built from linguistic rules. The Examples of use show examples from the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut of the word in a sentence along with a translation of the sentence in English, highlighting the word you looked up and its machine-generated English translation. If the word you are looking up doesn’t appear in the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, the English translations and Examples of use will only be shown for related words, but there may still be a Morphological decomposition.

When you look up an English word in the dictionary, you will just see machine-generated Inuktitut translations and Examples of use.

How does a machine generate a dictionary?

First, the computer program needs to have text in both English and Inuktitut. For this dictionary, we use the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, also called the Hansard, which are published in both English and Inuktitut. The Hansard contains sentences in Inuktitut and English that are translations of one another. A computer program called a “word aligner” goes through all of the sentence pairs that are translations of one another and counts how many times each possible pair of English and Inuktitut words or phrases shows up together. For example, most times that the word “tunngasugit” shows up in an Inuktitut sentence, the word “welcome” shows up in the English translation of that sentence. So the computer program will predict that “welcome” is a good English translation of “tunngasugit”. Sometimes the system can make mistakes, though. For example, if “tunngasugit” is often translated as “welcome back”, the program might predict that it just means “back”. This is one reason that it can be helpful to look at the examples to see words in context or look the morphological decomposition to see explanations of parts of the word. Like the translations, the sentence pairs from the Hansard are made automatically, so in some cases one side of the translation may have more or less information than the other or there might be certain words or phrases that are not translated.
