<h1>About the dictionary</h1>

The InuktiTools Inutktitut-English dictionary is 100% machine generated and its
content has not been verified by humans.
<p/>
As such, it may contain a lot of erroneous information but our experience is that
the partially correct information it provides is still useful in most situations.
<p/>
The sections below provide more details about how the various sections of the
dictionary are generated.

<h2>Translations</h2>

The translations provided in this section were generated automatically by a
machine and were not verified by a human.

<h2>Morphological Decomposition</h2>

<h2>Examples of use</h2>


A machine-generated dictionary finds possible translations of words using pairs of sentences that have been translated from English to Inuktitut or from Inuktitut to English. A computer program predicts that words might be translations of one another if they show up together frequently in sentences that are translations of one another. Most importantly, these translations have not been checked by people, so sometimes there will be mistakes. You may want to use other parts of the dictionary entry to get a better understanding of a term, or check with a fluent speaker.

When you look up an Inuktitut word in the dictionary, you will see up to four parts of the dictionary entry: English translations, Related words, Morphological decomposition, and Examples of use. English translations were machine-generated from the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut (see below for an explanation of how this is done). Related words are words that are similar to the word you looked up, for example ones that share the same root. The Morphological decomposition shows how the word can be broken down into smaller meaningful units. This is done by a different computer program built from linguistic rules. The Examples of use show examples from the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut of the word in a sentence along with a translation of the sentence in English, highlighting the word you looked up and its machine-generated English translation. If the word you are looking up doesn’t appear in the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, the English translations and Examples of use will only be shown for related words, but there may still be a Morphological decomposition.

When you look up an English word in the dictionary, you will just see machine-generated Inuktitut translations and Examples of use.

How does a machine generate a dictionary?

First, the computer program needs to have text in both English and Inuktitut. For this dictionary, we use the Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, also called the Hansard, which are published in both English and Inuktitut. The Hansard contains sentences in Inuktitut and English that are translations of one another. A computer program called a “word aligner” goes through all of the sentence pairs that are translations of one another and counts how many times each possible pair of English and Inuktitut words or phrases shows up together. For example, most times that the word “tunngasugit” shows up in an Inuktitut sentence, the word “welcome” shows up in the English translation of that sentence. So the computer program will predict that “welcome” is a good English translation of “tunngasugit”. Sometimes the system can make mistakes, though. For example, if “tunngasugit” is often translated as “welcome back”, the program might predict that it just means “back”. This is one reason that it can be helpful to look at the examples to see words in context or look the morphological decomposition to see explanations of parts of the word. Like the translations, the sentence pairs from the Hansard are made automatically, so in some cases one side of the translation may have more or less information than the other or there might be certain words or phrases that are not translated.
